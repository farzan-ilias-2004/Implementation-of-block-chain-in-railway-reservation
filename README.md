# 🚂 Blockchain Railway Reservation System

A **decentralized railway reservation system** built with Python that leverages blockchain technology to provide secure, transparent, and tamper-proof ticket booking and management.

## 🌟 Features

### Core Blockchain Features
- **Immutable Transaction Records** - All reservations stored on cryptographically secured blockchain
- **Proof-of-Work Consensus** - Mining mechanism with adjustable difficulty for network security
- **Smart Contract Integration** - Automated booking, cancellation, and refund processing
- **Decentralized Architecture** - No single point of failure with distributed ledger technology

### Railway System Features
- **Multi-User Support** - User registration, authentication, and profile management
- **Train Management** - Admin panel for adding trains, routes, and fare structures
- **Seat Availability** - Real-time tracking of seat inventory across all trains
- **PNR Status Tracking** - Blockchain-based ticket verification and status checking
- **Automated Refunds** - Smart contract-based cancellation policy enforcement
- **Route Search** - Find trains between source and destination stations

### Security Features
- **SHA-256 Cryptographic Hashing** - Ensures data integrity and prevents tampering
- **Secure Authentication** - Password hashing and user verification
- **Admin Access Control** - Protected administrative functions
- **Fraud Prevention** - Blockchain prevents double-booking and ticket forgery

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.7 or higher
- No external dependencies required (uses only standard library)

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/blockchain-railway-reservation.git
   cd blockchain-railway-reservation
   ```

2. **Run the application**
   ```
   python railway_blockchain.py
   ```

### Initial Setup

The system comes pre-configured with sample trains:
- **EXP001**: Mumbai → Pune → Bangalore (100 seats, $250/seat)
- **RAJ002**: Delhi → Jaipur → Mumbai (150 seats, $300/seat)

**Default Admin Credentials:**
- Username: `admin`
- Password: `railway_admin_2024`

## 📖 Usage Guide

### For Passengers

1. **Register Account**
   ```
   Main Menu → 1. Register New User
   ```

2. **Search Trains**
   ```
   Main Menu → 4. Search Trains
   Enter: Source, Destination, Date
   ```

3. **Book Tickets**
   ```
   Login → 1. Search & Book Trains
   Select train → Enter passenger details → Confirm booking
   ```

4. **Check PNR Status**
   ```
   Main Menu → 5. Check PNR Status
   Enter: Ticket ID
   ```

5. **Cancel Reservation**
   ```
   User Menu → 3. Cancel Ticket
   Enter: Ticket ID and reason
   ```

### For Administrators

1. **Access Admin Panel**
   ```
   Main Menu → 3. Admin Panel
   Login with admin credentials
   ```

2. **Add New Trains**
   ```
   Admin Panel → 1. Add New Train
   Enter: Train ID, Route, Seats, Fare
   ```

3. **Monitor System**
   ```
   Admin Panel → 3. View Blockchain Stats
   Check: Block count, pending transactions, chain validity
   ```

## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### Blockchain Structure
```
class Block:
    - index: Block number in chain
    - timestamp: Block creation time
    - data: Reservation transaction data
    - previous_hash: Hash of previous block
    - nonce: Proof-of-work number
    - hash: SHA-256 hash of block
```

### Smart Contract Functions
- `register_train()` - Add new train to network
- `book_ticket()` - Execute reservation with validation
- `cancel_ticket()` - Process cancellation and refund
- `validate_booking()` - Check seat availability and payment

### Mining Process
1. Collect pending reservations
2. Create new block with transaction data
3. Perform proof-of-work mining
4. Add validated block to chain
5. Distribute rewards to miners

## 🔐 Security Considerations

### Cryptographic Security
- **SHA-256 Hashing**: All blocks secured with cryptographic hashes
- **Password Security**: User passwords hashed and salted
- **Nonce Generation**: Secure random number generation for mining

### Business Logic Security
- **Double-Booking Prevention**: Blockchain consensus prevents duplicate reservations
- **Seat Inventory Protection**: Atomic operations ensure accurate seat counting
- **Refund Policy Enforcement**: Smart contracts automate fair refund calculations

### Data Integrity
- **Chain Validation**: Continuous verification of blockchain integrity
- **Tamper Detection**: Any modification attempt invalidates the chain
- **Audit Trail**: Complete history of all transactions and modifications

## 📊 Performance Metrics

| Metric                   | Value             |
